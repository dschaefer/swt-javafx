 * 
 * Class <code>DropTarget</code> defines the target object for a drag and drop
 * transfer.
 * 
 * <p>
 * IMPORTANT: This class is <em>not</em> intended to be subclassed.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class identifies the <code>Control</code> over which the user must
 * position the cursor in order to drop the data being transferred. It also
 * specifies what data types can be dropped on this control and what operations
 * can be performed. You may have several DropTragets in an application but
 * there can only be a one to one mapping between a <code>Control</code> and a
 * <code>DropTarget</code>. The DropTarget can receive data from within the same
 * application or from other applications (such as text dragged from a text
 * editor like Word).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <code><pre>
 * 	int operations = DND.DROP_MOVE | DND.DROP_COPY | DND.DROP_LINK;
 * 	Transfer[] types = new Transfer[] {TextTransfer.getInstance()};
 * 	DropTarget target = new DropTarget(label, operations);
 * 	target.setTransfer(types);
 * </code></pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The application is notified of data being dragged over this control and of
 * when a drop occurs by implementing the interface
 * <code>DropTargetListener</code> which uses the class
 * <code>DropTargetEvent</code>. The application can modify the type of drag
 * being performed on this Control at any stage of the drag by modifying the
 * <code>event.detail</code> field or the <code>event.currentDataType</code>
 * field. When the data is dropped, it is the responsibility of the application
 * to copy this data for its own purposes.
 * 
 * <code><pre>
 * 	target.addDropListener (new DropTargetListener() {
 * 		public void dragEnter(DropTargetEvent event) {};
 * 		public void dragOver(DropTargetEvent event) {};
 * 		public void dragLeave(DropTargetEvent event) {};
 * 		public void dragOperationChanged(DropTargetEvent event) {};
 * 		public void dropAccept(DropTargetEvent event) {}
 * 		public void drop(DropTargetEvent event) {
 * 			// A drop has occurred, copy over the data
 * 			if (event.data == null) { // no data to copy, indicate failure in event.detail
 * 				event.detail = DND.DROP_NONE;
 * 				return;
 * 			}
 * 			label.setText ((String) event.data); // data copied to label text
 * 		}
 * 	});
 * </pre></code>
