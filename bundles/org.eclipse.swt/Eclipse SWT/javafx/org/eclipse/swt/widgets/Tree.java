/**
 * Instances of this class provide a selectable user interface object that
 * displays a hierarchy of items and issues notification when an item in the
 * hierarchy is selected.
 * <p>
 * The item children that may be added to instances of this class must be of
 * type <code>TreeItem</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Style <code>VIRTUAL</code> is used to create a <code>Tree</code> whose
 * <code>TreeItem</code>s are to be populated by the client on an on-demand
 * basis instead of up-front. This can provide significant performance
 * improvements for trees that are very large or for which <code>TreeItem</code>
 * population is expensive (for example, retrieving values from an external
 * source).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Here is an example of using a <code>Tree</code> with style
 * <code>VIRTUAL</code>: <code><pre>
 *  final Tree tree = new Tree(parent, SWT.VIRTUAL | SWT.BORDER);
 *  tree.setItemCount(20);
 *  tree.addListener(SWT.SetData, new Listener() {
 *      public void handleEvent(Event event) {
 *          TreeItem item = (TreeItem)event.item;
 *          TreeItem parentItem = item.getParentItem();
 *          String text = null;
 *          if (parentItem == null) {
 *              text = "node " + tree.indexOf(item);
 *          } else {
 *              text = parentItem.getText() + " - " + parentItem.indexOf(item);
 *          }
 *          item.setText(text);
 *          System.out.println(text);
 *          item.setItemCount(10);
 *      }
 *  });
 * </pre></code>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that although this class is a subclass of <code>Composite</code>, it
 * does not normally make sense to add <code>Control</code> children to it, or
 * set a layout on it, unless implementing something like a cell editor.
