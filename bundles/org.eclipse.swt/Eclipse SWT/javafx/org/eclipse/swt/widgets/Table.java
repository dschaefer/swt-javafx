/**
 * Instances of this class implement a selectable user interface object that
 * displays a list of images and strings and issues notification when selected.
 * <p>
 * The item children that may be added to instances of this class must be of
 * type <code>TableItem</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Style <code>VIRTUAL</code> is used to create a <code>Table</code> whose
 * <code>TableItem</code>s are to be populated by the client on an on-demand
 * basis instead of up-front. This can provide significant performance
 * improvements for tables that are very large or for which
 * <code>TableItem</code> population is expensive (for example, retrieving
 * values from an external source).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Here is an example of using a <code>Table</code> with style
 * <code>VIRTUAL</code>: <code><pre>
 *  final Table table = new Table (parent, SWT.VIRTUAL | SWT.BORDER);
 *  table.setItemCount (1000000);
 *  table.addListener (SWT.SetData, new Listener () {
 *      public void handleEvent (Event event) {
 *          TableItem item = (TableItem) event.item;
 *          int index = table.indexOf (item);
 *          item.setText ("Item " + index);
 *          System.out.println (item.getText ());
 *      }
 *  }); 
 * </pre></code>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that although this class is a subclass of <code>Composite</code>, it
 * does not normally make sense to add <code>Control</code> children to it, or
 * set a layout on it, unless implementing something like a cell editor.
 * </p>
